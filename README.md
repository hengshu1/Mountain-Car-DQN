# Mountain-Car-DQN
This is a precise, clean, minimal and complete implementation of the DQN algorithm used in the Nature paper. It is demonstrated on Mountain Car.  

The training is shown in Mcar_train_curve, which shows that the trained DQN model has a high variance at testing time. 

I firmly believe something is wrong here. We can improve the high variance issue. This first paper will try to understand the data, regarding data distribution, and backbone samples.
